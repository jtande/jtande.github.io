  <h2 class="">Biography</h2>
  
  <p> I am computational Scientist with roots in chemistry.
    I hail from the West region of the Republic of Cameroon.
    I speak three languages, Ngemba, French and English, and
    I hold a bachelor of science in chemistry from the University
    of Buea in the South West Region of Cameroon. I am very happy
    that East Tennessee State University, with the precious help of
    Prof. Huang, gave me the opportunity to study in the US.

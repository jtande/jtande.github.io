<div class="blurb">
  <h1>Hi there, I'm Jacob Fosso Tande!</h1>
  <p> I am a computational scientist specialized in computing for curricular
    and research activities. In my day to day interactions, I act as an interface
    between the Information Technology department and the academic departments
    at my institution. As a research computing specialist, I advise researchers
    on computing needs, design, set up and maintained computing and information
    systems for scientific discovery. With the ever changing technological
    landscape, I keep abreast of the latest developments and organize workshops
    to update researchers on these new developments.
  </p>
  <p>My <em> metamorphic </em> path to become a computational scientist passed
    through the mastery of fundamental principles of the physical sciences. I
    studied Mathematics, Physics, Biology, Chemistry and Computer programming.
  </p>
  <p>
    With the understsanding of basic concepts, theories and principles at hand, I
    then embarked on a journey of scientific discovery, where, I used commodity
    and high performance computers along with scientific applications to
    investigate atomic and electronic processes of molecules and materials.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the course of my scientific inquisitions, I worked collaboratively, with
    experimentalists and theoreticians across many areas of the physical sciences.
    During this process, I developped a passion for setting up computing
    insfrastructures, interpreting computational output to provide experimentalists
    with insight into experimental observations, trouble-shoot computers attached to
    scientific instruments, became accustomed to interpreting scientific jargon
    accross disciplines and most important, I developped a "can do" mindset that
    keeps me doing what I love to do now. <a href="/about">Read more about my personage...</a>
